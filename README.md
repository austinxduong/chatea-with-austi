#### Ticket(s) 🦄 : 
```diff
■ Resolved:
+ Bug:"Warning: Each child in a list should have a unique “key” prop"
    - passed in index as second argument, assign index to key prop. assigned node to post prop
+ Bug: "Build Failed" - something about Netlify dependencies 
    - migrated to vercel

■ WIP: 
- Bug: Font "Raleway" renders as global font family in local/dev environment. But prod renders "Playfair" as entire font family instead.
    - attempted to create font family custom rule on tailwind.config file for raleway
    - attempted to ensure matching names in global.scss for font family key/prop
    - ensured correct import url for Raleway font
    - ensured correct spelling for font name in targeted class
    - cleared all cache in both chrome & brave browsers
    - switched from raleway font to outfit font
    - moved fontfamily key/prop value out of extend object, into theme object via tailwind.config
    - ensured proper syntax for custom css font family
    - ensured proper syntax for global.scss font family key/prop value
    - verified font name is passed in the dom via dev tools. but actual font is not rendered on client
    (isolate the issue even more)
        - font renders locally, but not prod. so it works. it seems the request is being made from the client, but the request isn't being sent
